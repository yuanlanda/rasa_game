      Cuts and scrapes can become infected, and should be cleaned. 
      They may heal in the open or be protected by bandages. 
      The best treatment for serious bleeding is direct pressure.

      Shoes will protect you from cutting your feet.

      Next tip...
      You need to find fresh water.
      Human can't live anymore than 8 to 10 days without water.
      Sources of freshwater include streams, waterfalls and rain.
      You'll need at least one liter of water per day.

      You can drink. But human kidneys can only make urine that is less salty than salt water. 
      Therefore, to get rid of all the excess salt taken in by drinking seawater, you have to urinate more water than you drank. 
      Eventually, you die of dehydration even as you become thirstier.
